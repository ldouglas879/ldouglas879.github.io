<h1>The Summer Before the Season</h1>
<p>The Boston Celtics in the 2022-2023 season fell short as they lost to the Miami Heat in game 7 of the Eastern Confrence Finals. This called for some change Brad Stevens who was newly appointed President of Operations for the team made some deals. He traded four key pieces that made the Celtics the team they were in Marcus Smart, Robert Williams III, Grant Williams, and Malcom Brogdon who had just come off a season were he won the 6th man of the year award. The two additions that they had made were perfect in Kristaps Prozingis and Jrue Holiday. Porzingis being a stretch big who could play the five and shoot the lights out was just the player they needed as Al Horford was getting older. Then, Jrue Holiday was already proven to be the best gaurd defender in the league and a winner as he already had a championship under his belt. Now the Celtics were the clear favorite to win the NBA Finals entering the season. </p>

    <h1>Joe Mazulla</h1>
    <p>Joe Mazulla was entering his second year as Head Coach for the Boston Celtics were he had to prove he belonged in the NBA. The previous year was the Interm Head Coach as Ime Udoka had legal trouble that ulitatemly led him to being fired from his job. There were many doubts of Mazulla entering the season as he had not proven he could control his team the year before. He could not keep them disicipline enough and ultimately he did not have enough experience in being a Head Coach to make the right desicions when it mattered. Joe crumbled in high pressure situations the year before many times where he did not call timeouts or draw up the right play. He had to prove that he belonged in the NBA as one of the superior Head Coach's in the league. </p>
    <h1>The Preseason</h1>
    <p>This new and improved Celtics roster had a stellar Preseason as they went 4-1 in the 5 games that they played. Young players like Payton Pritchard and Sam Hauser proved that they had gotten better over the offseason and look to be solid role players coming off the bench during the regular season. Also, the starting lineup looked like one of the best lineups assembled in long time with Jrue Holiday at Point Gaurd, Derrick White at Shooting Gaurd, Jaylen Brown at Small Forward, Jayson Tatum at Power Forward, and Kristaps Prozingis at Center. They looked utterly unstoppable. Every Boston fan was just hoping they carry this into the regular season.</p>
